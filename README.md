# Notes for Build

Try to use default auth packages for Next:
https://next-auth.js.org/faq#databases

I will need a DB to store tokens but lets just get auth working for now. 

Then Ill focusing on the DB & hosting.  

Heroku might be a possible hosting solution.

My sql is probably the best DB option for now.
